# Tic Tac Toe Game

This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game developed as a learning project for the [Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/). It was built as part of the JavaScript course, where I had the opportunity to practice and deepen my understanding of the language while building a fully functional game.

## Live Demo

You can play the live version of the game here: [Tic Tac Toe Game Live](https://shihabhasan0161.github.io/TicTacToeGame/)

## Project Overview

- **Built With:** HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- **Purpose:** To learn and implement fundamental JavaScript concepts including DOM manipulation, event handling, and game logic.
- **Lessons learned:**  Working on this project has been a significant part of my learning journey. I gained valuable insights into JavaScript and web development through:
  - Implementing game logic from scratch.
  - Understanding how to manipulate the DOM dynamically.
  - Learning best practices for code organization and debugging.

## How to Play

1. Open the game in your browser using the live demo link above.
2. Two players take turns clicking on the board to place their mark (X or O).
3. The first player to align three marks in a row, column, or diagonal wins.
4. In case of a tie, the draw game will increment and to play the next game, you have to refresh the board.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
